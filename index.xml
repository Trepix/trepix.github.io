                <content>&lt;p&gt;After getting over the first little detail of having a website, here we are writing the first post. I wanted to believe that writing wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult as it seemed, but here&amp;rsquo;s the reality to smash our face again.
So I will try to be brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the first and &lt;strong&gt;most important&lt;/strong&gt; disclaimer before going in about the whys of this blog is that everything I&amp;rsquo;m going to write here is just my experience, my learning and opinions. And don&amp;rsquo;t forget that opinions are like farts: everyone farts, everyone likes their own and other&amp;rsquo;s farts are usually unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first objective that I want to hit, is to improve my knowledge retention. Over the last years, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot of books but nowadays I can only retain a few core ideas and sometimes others just ring me a bell and I have to look them up. As opposed, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I&amp;rsquo;ve internalized better coding techniques like refactoring or TDD because I practiced them, again and again. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to try summarizing each book in order to retain the core information. Probably I will read fewer books, but let&amp;rsquo;s see if I have a higher ROI of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is &lt;strong&gt;maybe&lt;/strong&gt; helping another lost traveler like me. This road is long, not always easy and certainly not clear. Probably, I will not share useful learnings for everyone (nor do I pretend it) but maybe someone who&amp;rsquo;s some steps behind could find something useful. If you find something helpful here don&amp;rsquo;t forget to share with others what you learned (the knowledge, not my blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last reason to write this blog is to improve my English, so I hope will have enough energy to write some posts in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you find something useful every once in a while. And don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to share your opinion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Kudos to Anna for help me with my English ðŸ˜˜&lt;/p&gt;
