      overview: "It was my first contact with ideas that nowadays I consider essential for software development. Agile practices and values; techniques such as TDD and continuous integration; and a shallow understanding of what is value. 
      <br>
      Also, we had to deal with the technical debt that we generated at the early stages. Due to this experience, I started to take consciousness of it and to learn about how to avoid, control or reduce it."
