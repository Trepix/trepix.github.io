# a summary about you
summary: "I am a passionate software crafter with experience in backend and bigdata. Over the last few years, I adopted different roles to bring value where the company needed it. At each change I have tried to take care of two very important things to me: learn and make an impact. 


Due to the apprenticeship program, I rediscovered how I love to teach and help others to growth so I'm focusing to get more knowledge and learn how to transfer it."
