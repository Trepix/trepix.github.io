Yep, here we are. After get over the first little detail of having a website, here we are writing the first post. I wanted to belive that writing wasn't as difficult as it seemed, but here's the reality to smash our face again.
So I will try to be brief.

Regarding something, there are always 5 questions whose answers are considered basic in information gathering: _The Five Ws_.
Who?, When?, What? and Where? have obvious awnsers if we think about this blog. But _Why?_ this is not at all noticeable and it really talks more about me and my intentions than the rest of the questions. So **why** I'm getting into this mess?

Well, the first and **most important** disclaimer before going in about the whys is that everything I'm going to write here is just my experiences, my learnings and opinions. And don't forget that opinions are like farts: everyone farts, everyone likes their own and other's farts are usually unpleasant.

The first objective that I want to hit, is to improve my knowledge retention. In the last years, I've read a lot of books but nowadays I can only retain a few core ideas and sometimes others just ring me a bell and I have to search them. As opposed, I've noticed that I've internalized better coding techniques like refactoring or TDD because I practiced them, again and again. So I'm going to try summarizing each book in order to retain. Probably I will read fewer books, let's see if I have a higher ROI of my time. 

The second is **maybe** help another lost traveler like me. This road is long, not always easy and even less clear. Probably, I will not share useful learnings for everyone (nor I don't pretend it) but maybe someone who's some steps behind my journey could find something useful. If you find something useful here don't forget to share with others what you learned (the knowledge, not my blog).

And the last but not least, sometimes (if I have enough energy) I will keep writing in English, so I hope to improve it.

Hope you find something useful once (if not, don't hesitate to share your opinion).
