### intro
Yep, here we are. After get over the first little detail of having a website, here we are writing the first post. I wanted to belive that writing wasn't as difficult as it seemed, but here's the reality to smash our face again 🤷🏻‍♂️.
So I will try to be brief.

_Who?_, _When?_, _What?_ and _Where?_ are obvious questions if we think about this blog. But _Why?_ this is not at all noticeable and it really talks more about me and my intentions than the rest of the questions. So **why** I'm getting into this mess?


### why
#### not guru
#### just a way to retain knowledge
#### share maybe someone could find something useful
#### yeah why not personal brand
#### and maybe improve my english
