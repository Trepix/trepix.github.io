The last technical book that I've recently read is this one. Manu Rivero recommended it to me insomuch as he'd readed recently, and I trust his criteria, so I decided to read it.

Before going deeper into the content, I've to say that the book is really well writen. It has a smooth reading and it was never stodgy. It's accompanied by some drawings which are good representations of what Ron is trying to explain in each page, maybe they are not perfect but are simple and effective.


### recommeded by Manu
