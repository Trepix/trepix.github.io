The last technical book that I've recently read is this one. Manu Rivero recommended it to me inasmuch as he'd readed recently, and I trust his criteria, so I decided to read it.

Before going deeper into the content, I've to say that the book is really well writen. It has a smooth reading and it was never stodgy. It's accompanied by some drawings which are good representations of what the author is trying to explain in each page, they are not perfect but are simple and effective.

In my opinion, one of the most valuable things that this book brought me, are the questions. If you read the book all at once you will find interesting ideas (or not) but at every chapter you can find a good questions that maybe could help you to analyze a little bit in depth your day to day.
